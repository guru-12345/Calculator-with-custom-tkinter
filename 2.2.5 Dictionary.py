#Run the code and observe the output.
#Task 1- Create a dictionary named "my_friends", where the keys are your friends' names and the values are their ages. 
#Then, print the age of one friend


# Create a dictionary with names as keys and ages as values
people = {"Alice": 12, "Bob": 14, "Charlie": 13}

# Access a value using a key
print(people["Alice"])  # This will print 12, the age of Alice
