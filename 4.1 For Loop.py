# Chapter 4 - Making Buttons Visible Using Loops
# Session 9 & 10
# 4.1 For Loop: A for loop helps us repeat something many times.

# Example 1: Basic for loop using range()
# The range(start, stop) function gives numbers from start to stop-1.
for i in range(1, 11):  
    print(i)  # Shows numbers from 1 to 10

# Task 1: Change the code to print numbers from 20 to 30.


# Example 2: Using a step in range()
# The third number tells how much to skip each time.
for i in range(1, 21, 2):  
    print(i)  # Shows every second number from 1 to 20

# Task 2: Change the code to print numbers from 50 to 5, skipping 5 each time.


# Example 3: Going through a list
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)  # Shows each fruit name

# Task 3: Change the code to show each fruit name in capital letters.
