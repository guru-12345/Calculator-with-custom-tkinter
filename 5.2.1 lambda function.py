Why Use Lambda?
1-> Itâ€™s a shortcut for small functions.
2->No need to write def and return.
3->Useful for quick, one-time calculations.'''

#Task 1- Modify the lambda function to triple the number instead of doubling it. 
#Then, print the result for 5

double = lambda x: x * 2  
print(double(4))
