# Why Use Lambda?
# 1. It’s a shortcut for small functions.
# 2. No need to write 'def' and 'return'.
# 3. Useful for quick, one-time calculations.
# 4. In GUI libraries like CustomTkinter, lambda is useful when passing arguments to functions in buttons or events.

#Task - 1 - Make a lambda function to multiply a number by 3.

# Lambda function to double a number

double = lambda x: x * 2  
print(double(4)) 

# lambda x: x * 2 → This is a lambda function that takes a number (x) and returns double its value.
# double(4) → Calls the function with 4, so it returns 4 * 2 = 8.
